        <h1>Xi Jinping in Vietnam to rekindle a love-hate relationship</h1>
        <p>1 day ago</p>

        <strong>
          When Chinese leader Xi Jinping meets his Vietnamese counterpart,
          Nguyen Phu Trong on Tuesday, on a state visit to Vietnam, expect a
          fountain of flowery compliments exalting the historic friendship
          between these two communist-run neighbours.
        </strong>
        <p>
          Mr Trong visited Beijing a year ago and was given China's top medal
          for foreign dignitaries, with Mr Xi describing their relationship as
          one between "comrades and brothers", the two countries "connected by
          mountains and rivers, as close as lips and teeth".
        </p>
        <p>
          Vietnam is expected to announce it will join Mr Xi's "Community of
          Common Destiny", a Sino-centric, largely symbolic conception which is
          widely viewed as a challenge to the prevailing, US-led global order.
        </p>
        <p>
          That would neatly nudge China one step ahead of the US in their
          competition for Vietnam's allegiance, after the US, in a surprise
          move, had its status elevated to that of "Comprehensive Strategic
          Partner" during President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi in September.
          This put Washington on the same level as Beijing in Vietnam's
          carefully calibrated hierarchy of international partners.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this week's visit, China will also be offering its advanced
          railway technology to help Vietnam upgrade its transport
          infrastructure. This includes a rail link from southern China to the
          Vietnamese port of Haiphong, which passes through a region that has
          some of Vietnam's richest rare earth deposits - China is the world's
          biggest exporter and refiner of the minerals which are essential to
          produce electric vehicles and renewable energy.

          What they will certainly not talk about, at least publicly, is the
          bitter territorial dispute between them over islands in the South
          China Sea, nor their acrimonious relationship in the 1970s and 80s,
          which included a full-scale border war in 1979 that killed thousands
          of soldiers on both sides. There will also certainly be no mention of
          China's long historic colonisation of Vietnam, known there as "nghìn
          năm bắc thuộc" or 1,000 years of northern occupation, or of Vietnam's
          grievances over the impact of Chinese dams on the Mekong river.
        </p>
        <p>
          But these points of friction are being discussed online in Vietnam,
          where the internet is less tightly policed than China.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We only want peace, so President Xi please don't come," wrote one
          Vietnamese Facebook user. "If Xi Jinping removes the nine-dash line,
          the two countries can become brothers immediately," wrote another,
          referring to China's expansive claim to nearly all of the South China
          Sea.

        Public sentiment in Vietnam can be more fiercely anti-Chinese than
        anywhere else in South East Asia. It is stirred by the proud nationalism
        of a country which won its independence after defeating both the French
        and the Americans, and by historic fear of its giant northern neighbour.
        This sentiment has always required careful handling by Vietnam's
        communist leaders.
